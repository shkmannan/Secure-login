#  Secure OTP Sender (RyuuK32 USB Auth)

A Python script for sending OTPs (One-Time Passwords) via email, protected by **USB-based authentication** and an **admin password**.

---

##  Features

*  **Multi-factor authentication**: Requires both a USB drive with a secret file and an admin password.
*  **OTP delivery**: Sends a randomly generated OTP to any email via Gmail SMTP.
*  **Credential security**: Uses environment variables to store sensitive data safely.
*  **User-friendly**: Clear CLI prompts and helpful error messages.
*  **Fun denial**: Opens a YouTube short if authentication fails (because why not?).

---

##  Requirements

* Python **3.7+**
* Gmail account with **App Passwords** enabled
* A USB drive (default `D:`) with a file `otp_auth_key.txt` containing your secret code

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shkmannan/secure-login.git

```env
GMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
APP_PASSWORD=your_generated_app_password
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
```

Or set them directly in your shell environment.

### 4. Prepare USB Authentication

* Insert your USB drive (default `D:` ‚Äî change in script if needed)
* On that drive, create a file named: `otp_auth_key.txt`
* Add your **secret code** (no spaces or newlines) to that file
